On November 15, 2024, at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Jake Paul secured a unanimous decision victory over boxing legend Mike Tyson. The bout, streamed on Netflix, attracted significant attention, with over 70,000 attendees and an estimated 120 million viewers, despite technical issues during the broadcast. 

The match consisted of eight two-minute rounds. Paul, 27, demonstrated superior speed and endurance, landing 78 punches compared to Tyson's 18. Tyson, 58, appeared fatigued and struggled to keep pace, leading to a clear decision in favor of Paul. 

The fight received widespread criticism. Fans expressed disappointment over Tyson's performance and questioned the ethics of allowing a 58-year-old to compete against a much younger opponent. The Texas Athletic Commission faced scrutiny for sanctioning the bout, with many calling it a "sad disgrace" to the sport. 

Paul praised Tyson's legacy, stating, "He's a legend, and it was an honor to share the ring with him." Tyson acknowledged his limitations, expressing uncertainty about future fights: "I gave it my all, but time catches up with everyone." 

In the co-main event, Ireland's Katie Taylor retained her super lightweight title against Puerto Rico's Amanda Serrano in a contentious unanimous decision. Despite a deep cut from a head clash and a point deduction for head butts, Taylor emerged victorious with all judges scoring 95-94 in her favor. Taylor and Serrano, who previously fought in 2022, anticipate a third rematch. 

The event has sparked discussions about the ethics of intergenerational fights and the responsibilities of athletic commissions in ensuring the safety and integrity of boxing matches.
